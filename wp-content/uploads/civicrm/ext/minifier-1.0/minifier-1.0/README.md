# minifier

If enabled, this extension minifies CSS/JS files which are passed through the assetbuilder in CiviCRM.

For example if it is installed on a CiviCRM system it will minify crm-menubar.css. If Stripe is installed it will minify stripe css/js.

The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).

## Requirements

* PHP v7.2+
* CiviCRM 5.28+

## Installation

See: https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest/customize/extensions/#installing-a-new-extension

## Usage

The extension calls hook_civicrm_buildAsset after all other buildAsset hooks have been called.

The extension works in two ways:
1. If the `$content` variable is not empty it will minify and return that (this would normally happen when an extension has implemented hook_civicrm_buildAsset for a specific file).
1. If the `$content` variable is empty and `$params['path']` specifies a full path to a file it will be loaded and minified.
